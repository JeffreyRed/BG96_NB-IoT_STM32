# BG96_NB-IoT_STM32
Project that connect Cloud, and device using NB-IoT technology over LTE.

Description:
Low Power Mode L476RG CubeMx-Cube File -> to get the pins with code configuration.

Low_Power_mode and RTC_Cumulocity_BG96_L476RG - C code , Final Draft L476 board. -> Code that connect to cloud and send the data with NB-IoT
UART_Timer_L476RG_BG96_Shield - First draft using timer and sending data to cumulocity- > Code that connect to cloud and send the data with NB-IoT, and timers
Low Power Mode and RTC_ BG96_L073 - C code, Final draft L073 board -> Code that connect to cloud and send the data with NB-IoT
